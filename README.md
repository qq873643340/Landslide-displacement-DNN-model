# Landslide-displacement-DNN-model
This tool, called landslide displacement DNN Prediction model, uses a deep neural network framework to predict landslide displacement through input parameters such as ac, PGA, PGV, AI, CAV, Tm, and DS5-75. There are two folders in the compressed file, respectively corresponding to DNN7 and DNN8 in the paper. The input file is Input_Data.xlsx, and the output file is Output_Data.xlsx. First put the model file, EXE program, input and output file in the same directory, then modify the input file, and finally run the EXE file to get the landslide displacement value.
